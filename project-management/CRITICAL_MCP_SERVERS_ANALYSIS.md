## Current MCP Servers in Our Configuration

1. **filesystem** - File operations
2. **git** - Version control
3. **time** - Time operations
4. **playwright** - Browser automation and testing
5. **searxng** - Web search fallback
6. **context7** - Official documentation lookup
7. **sequential-thinking** - Complex problem solving
8. **magic** - UI component generation
9. **serena** - Code analysis and navigation
10. **crawl4ai** - Web content extraction
11. **fetch** - URL fetching

  - SMTP MCP: `npx -y mcp-server-smtp`
- **Key Features**:
  - Send emails with templates
  - Attachment support
  - Bulk email capabilities

### üìä Priority 3: Monitoring and Operations

#### 7. **Grafana MCP Server**
- **Purpose**: Monitoring and observability
- **Why Critical**: Solo devs need simple monitoring
- **Key Features**:
  - Dashboard management
  - Alert configuration
  - Metrics visualization

#### 8. **Fly.io MCP Server**
- **Purpose**: Fly.io deployment and management
- **Why Critical**: Another primary deployment target
- **Installation**: Built into `flyctl mcp`
- **Key Features**:
  - App deployment
  - Machine management
  - Remote MCP server hosting

### üîç Notable Mentions

1. **Docker MCP Catalog** - Access to 100+ containerized MCP servers
2. **MCP Connect** - Bridge for exposing local MCPs (ngrok alternative)
3. **Render MCP** - Not found; may need custom development

## Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Update `.claude/settings.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docker": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@docker/mcp"]
    },
    "railway": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@jason-tan-swe/railway-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "RAILWAY_API_TOKEN": "${RAILWAY_API_TOKEN}"
      }
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres",
        "${DATABASE_URL}"
      ]
    },
    "stripe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@stripe/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "STRIPE_API_KEY": "${STRIPE_API_KEY}"
      }
    },
    "redis": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "redis/mcp-redis"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Environment Variable Management

Create a `.env.example` file with required tokens:
```bash
RAILWAY_API_TOKEN=your_railway_token
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### 3. Agent Integration

Update agent YAML configurations to use these MCPs:
- Deploy Agent: Use Railway/Fly.io MCPs
- Feature Agent: Use Stripe/Email MCPs for features
- Debug Agent: Use Docker MCP for container debugging
- Database Agent: Use PostgreSQL/Redis MCPs

### 4. Security Considerations

1. **Use restricted API keys** where possible
2. **Enable human confirmation** for sensitive operations
3. **Implement OAuth** for production deployments
4. **Sandbox MCP operations** in development

## Migration Path

1. **Week 1**: Add Docker, Railway, PostgreSQL MCPs
2. **Week 2**: Integrate Stripe, Redis, Email MCPs
3. **Week 3**: Add monitoring (Grafana) and Fly.io
4. **Week 4**: Test full integration and security

## Conclusion

Adding these MCP servers will transform our cookiecutter template into a truly AI-powered development environment. The combination of deployment (Railway/Fly.io), infrastructure (Docker), data (PostgreSQL/Redis), features (Stripe/Email), and monitoring (Grafana) MCPs provides everything a solo developer needs to build and ship applications at superhuman speed.

The Docker MCP Catalog also opens up access to 100+ additional servers, making this architecture infinitely extensible as new needs arise.
