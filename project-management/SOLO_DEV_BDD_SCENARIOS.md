# Solo Dev BDD Scenarios: Features That Actually Matter 🎯

## Feature: Deploy to the Internet in 30 Seconds

### Scenario: First deployment ever
```gherkin
Given I just built something cool locally
When I run "make deploy"
Then I should be prompted to connect my Railway/Fly account (one time only)
And my app should be live on the internet within 30 seconds
And I should see a real URL I can share
And the database should just work without any configuration
```

### Scenario: Ship an update
```gherkin
Given my app is already deployed
When I change some code and run "make ship"
Then it should automatically:
  - Commit my changes with a generated message
  - Push to GitHub
  - Deploy to production
  - Show me the URL
And the whole thing should take less than a minute
```

## Feature: AI That Writes Boring Code

### Scenario: Generate a complete auth system
```gherkin
Given I need user authentication
When I type "make add-feature auth" or tell Claude "add user auth"
Then it should create:
  - User registration endpoints
  - Login/logout functionality  
  - Password reset emails
  - Session management
  - Basic UI components
And it should work immediately without configuration
```

### Scenario: CRUD in 10 seconds
```gherkin
Given I need basic CRUD for a "products" model
When I run "make crud products name:string price:decimal"
Then I should get:
  - Database model and migrations
  - All REST endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Basic admin interface
  - API documentation
  - Example frontend code
And Claude should understand this model in future conversations
```

## Feature: Instant Sharing with Anyone

### Scenario: Show my local app to someone
```gherkin
Given I'm working on localhost:8000
When I run "make share"
Then I should get:
  - A public HTTPS URL that works immediately
  - A QR code in my terminal
  - Optional password protection
  - The URL should work for 8 hours
And my friend should be able to see my app on their phone
```

### Scenario: Quick demo mode
```gherkin
Given I want to show off my app
When I run "make demo"
Then it should:
  - Create a fresh database with good-looking demo data
  - Disable any dangerous operations
  - Add a "DEMO MODE" banner
  - Generate shareable link
  - Auto-cleanup after 24 hours
```

## Feature: Magical Development Experience

### Scenario: TODO comments become code
```gherkin
Given I write "# TODO: send welcome email to new users"
When I save the file
Then Claude should:
  - Notice the TODO
  - Generate the email sending code
  - Add it right below the TODO
  - Include error handling
  - Ask me to review before applying
```

### Scenario: Errors fix themselves
```gherkin
Given I get a common error like "Module not found"
When Claude sees the error
Then it should:
  - Automatically install the missing package
  - Update requirements.txt
  - Restart the server
  - Tell me what it fixed
And I should never see that error again
```

## Feature: Money Mode 💰

### Scenario: Add payments in 2 minutes
```gherkin
Given I want to charge money for my app
When I run "make add-feature payments"
Then it should:
  - Add Stripe integration
  - Create a pricing page
  - Handle subscriptions
  - Set up webhooks
  - Add a customer portal
And I just need to add my Stripe keys
```

### Scenario: Track everything that matters
```gherkin
Given my app is making money
When I run "make stats"
Then I should see:
  - Current MRR
  - Active users today
  - Signups this week
  - Current costs (hosting)
  - Profit!
But NOT 50 different metrics I don't care about
```

## Feature: Stay in the Flow

### Scenario: Everything persists across restarts
```gherkin
Given I'm deep in a coding session
When the container restarts for any reason
Then:
  - My terminal history should be preserved
  - Database should have all my data
  - Any running processes should restart
  - My half-written code should be saved
  - Claude should remember our conversation context
```

### Scenario: Instant environment reset
```gherkin
Given I've messed something up badly
When I run "make fresh"
Then it should:
  - Reset the database
  - Clear caches
  - Reinstall dependencies
  - Keep my code changes
  - Be ready to code in < 30 seconds
```

## Feature: Git for Humans

### Scenario: Save my work
```gherkin
Given I've been coding for a while
When I run "make save" or just "make s"
Then it should:
  - Stage all changes
  - Generate a commit message from the changes
  - Commit and push
  - Create a backup tag
  - Show me a fun emoji
```

### Scenario: Oops, go back
```gherkin
Given I broke something in the last hour
When I run "make undo"
Then it should:
  - Show me recent saves with timestamps
  - Let me pick one to go back to
  - Restore code and database state
  - Keep the "bad" version in a branch just in case
```

## Feature: The Vibe Check

### Scenario: Morning startup ritual
```gherkin
Given I open VS Code in the morning
When the environment starts
Then I should see:
  - A friendly message
  - What I was working on yesterday
  - Any overnight errors (if any)
  - Motivational coding tip
  - Maybe a ASCII art coffee ☕
```

### Scenario: End of day wrap-up
```gherkin
Given I'm done coding for the day
When I run "make done"
Then it should:
  - Save all work
  - Push to GitHub
  - Create a daily backup
  - Show me what I accomplished
  - Remind me to deploy if I haven't
  - Say goodnight 🌙
```

## What We're NOT Testing

❌ Load balancing - You don't have that much load yet  
❌ Kubernetes deployment - You're not at that scale  
❌ Multi-region failover - Your region is your bedroom  
❌ A/B testing infrastructure - Just ask your users  
❌ Complex branching strategies - main branch + YOLO  
❌ Security audits - Add security when you have something to secure  

## The One True Success Metric

```gherkin
Given I have an idea at 2 AM
When I use this dev environment
Then I should have a working prototype deployed before I fall asleep
And I should feel like a wizard 🧙‍♂️
