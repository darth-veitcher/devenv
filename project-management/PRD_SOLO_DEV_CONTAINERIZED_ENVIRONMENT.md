# Product Requirements Document: Solo Dev Containerized Environment with AI Agents

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Target Audience**: Solo developers building web applications  

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for enhancing the existing containerized development environment cookiecutter template to create the ultimate Minimum Lovable Product (MLP) for solo developers. The enhancement leverages Claude Code's new agent capabilities (2025) to provide parallel AI assistance, enabling solo developers to build and deploy applications 10x faster than traditional methods.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Sequential Development**: Solo devs work on one task at a time, causing slow progress
2. **Context Switching**: Constant jumping between coding, debugging, deploying, and documenting
3. **Deployment Friction**: Complex steps between localhost and live production
4. **Boilerplate Burden**: Repeatedly writing auth, payments, and other common features
5. **Isolation**: Debugging alone at 2 AM with no help

### Opportunity
Claude Code's new agent system (January 2025) enables spawning up to 10 parallel AI agents, each with independent context windows. This transforms solo development from a sequential process to a parallel, assisted workflow.

## Vision

Transform solo developers into "AI Orchestra Conductors" who focus on creativity and vision while AI agents handle implementation, deployment, and maintenance tasks in parallel.

### Core Philosophy
- **Ship, Don't Configure**: Zero-friction from idea to deployed app
- **Magic, Not Manual**: Common tasks should feel magical, not laborious  
- **Fun, Not Frightening**: Deployment should spark joy, not anxiety
- **Hours, Not Weeks**: Ideas become reality in hours, not weeks

## User Personas

### Primary: The Basement Vibe-Coder
- **Age**: 20-35
- **Context**: Coding from home, often late at night
- **Goals**: Ship ideas quickly, get user feedback, maybe make money
- **Pain Points**: Hates DevOps, gets stuck on configuration, loses motivation during setup
- **Success**: "I had an idea at 10 PM and it was live with users by midnight"

### Secondary: The Weekend Warrior
- **Age**: 25-45  
- **Context**: Has a day job, builds side projects on weekends
- **Goals**: Maximize limited coding time, build portfolio, potentially escape 9-5
- **Pain Points**: Limited time, rusty on latest practices, needs things to "just work"
- **Success**: "I built and launched a complete SaaS in one weekend"

## Core Requirements

### 1. Agent Army System

#### 1.1 Deployment Agent
- **Capabilities**: Build, test, deploy to Railway/Fly/Render with zero configuration

#### 1.3 Debug Detective Agent
- **Capabilities**: Auto-detect and fix errors before developer notices
- **Triggers**: Console errors, failed builds, test failures
- **Success Criteria**: 90% of common errors fixed automatically

#### 1.4 Optimization Agent

### 5. Development Experience

#### 5.1 Morning Ritual
- Show yesterday's progress
- Pull latest changes
- Update dependencies
- Run health checks
- Display motivational message

#### 5.2 Power Commands
- `make idea` - Research → Design → Build → Deploy
- `make better` - Parallel improvements across codebase
- `make fix-all` - Fix all errors and warnings
- `make night-shift` - Overnight optimization

#### 5.3 Error Handling
- Auto-fix common errors (missing imports, type errors)
- Intelligent error messages with solutions
- One-click fixes for complex issues
- Learning from previous fixes
