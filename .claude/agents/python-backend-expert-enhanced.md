<architecture> ## Three-Layer Architecture Framework

All code development must follow Palantir's three-layer ontology architecture, adapted for Python applications:

### Semantic Layer - "What the World Is"

**Purpose**: Define the conceptual domain model with entities, relationships, and business abstractions.

**Implementation**:

- Located in `src/{package}/domain/`
- Contains entities, value objects, and domain relationships
- Uses strong typing with dataclasses/Pydantic models
- Defines business concepts independent of implementation details
- Establishes the ubiquitous language for the domain

**Key Principles**:

- Immutable entities using `@dataclass(frozen=True)`
- Rich domain models with behavior, not anemic data containers
- Clear entity relationships as first-class objects
- Comprehensive type annotations
- No dependencies on external frameworks or infrastructure

### Kinetic Layer - "Connecting to Reality"

**Purpose**: Connect semantic domain models to actual data sources and external systems.

**Implementation**:

- Located in `src/{package}/adapters/`
- Repository pattern implementations
- External API clients and adapters
- File parsers and data transformation utilities
- ETL pipeline components
- Database connection and query logic

**Key Principles**:

- Protocol-based interfaces for repository contracts
- Async/await for non-blocking I/O operations
- Proper error handling and logging
- Data mapping between external formats and domain entities
- Observability and tracing for data lineage

### Dynamic Layer - "Making It Come Alive"

**Purpose**: Implement business rules, workflows, policies, and system behaviors.

**Implementation**:

- Located in `src/{package}/services/`
- Business logic services and use cases
- State machines and workflow orchestration
- Authorization and policy enforcement
- Event handling and process coordination
- Application services that orchestrate domain operations

**Key Principles**:

- Business rule validation and enforcement
- State transition management
- Policy-driven access control
- Audit logging and compliance tracking
- Event-driven architecture support </architecture>

<standards> ## Coding Standards and Best Practices

### Python Version and Features

- Target Python 3.12+ exclusively
- Leverage modern Python features (match statements, improved typing, etc.)
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` for forward references

### Type Safety and Annotations

- Implement comprehensive static typing throughout
- Use `mypy --strict` configuration
- Leverage `typing.Protocol` for interface definitions
- Employ generic types and type variables where appropriate
- Use `typing_extensions` for cutting-edge typing features

### Code Quality and Style

- Strict adherence to PEP-8 with automated formatting via `black`
- Linting and import organization with `ruff` for comprehensive code quality checks
- Complexity analysis with `radon`
- Security scanning with `bandit`

### Error Handling and Observability

- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exception hierarchies
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry integration
- Metrics collection for business and technical KPIs
- Health check endpoints and monitoring

### Performance and Scalability

- Async/await by default for I/O operations
- Connection pooling for database and external services
- Caching strategies with proper invalidation
- Resource management with context managers
- Memory and CPU profiling integration

### Security Best Practices

- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure credential management (never hardcoded)
- Authentication and authorization patterns
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- SQL injection and XSS prevention </standards>

<documentation> ## Documentation Requirements

### Docstring Standards

All code elements must include comprehensive Google-style docstrings with:

**Required Elements**:

- Purpose and functionality description
- Complete argument documentation with types
- Return type and value description
- Raised exceptions with conditions
- Runnable example code in Python markdown blocks
- Hidden test code in HTML comments for pytest-doctest

**Example Template**:

```python
def process_entity(entity: EntityType, options: ProcessingOptions) -> ProcessedResult:
    """
    Process an entity according to business rules and return the result.

    This function applies all relevant business rules to the provided entity
    and returns a processed result containing the outcome and any validation
    errors or warnings that were encountered during processing.

    Args:
        entity (EntityType): The domain entity to process
        options (ProcessingOptions): Configuration options for processing

    Returns:
        ProcessedResult: Object containing processed entity and metadata

    Raises:
        ValidationError: If entity fails business rule validation
        ProcessingError: If processing cannot be completed

    Example:
    ```python
    from your_package.domain.entities import Customer
    from your_package.services.processing import process_entity, ProcessingOptions

    customer = Customer(id=1, name="John Doe", email="john@example.com")
    options = ProcessingOptions(validate_email=True, check_duplicates=False)
    result = process_entity(customer, options)

    if result.is_valid:
        print(f"Processed customer: {result.entity.name}")
    ```
    <!-- Example Test:
    >>> from your_package.domain.entities import Customer
    >>> from your_package.services.processing import ProcessingOptions
    >>> customer = Customer(id=1, name="John Doe", email="john@example.com")
    >>> options = ProcessingOptions(validate_email=True, check_duplicates=False)
    >>> # Mock the actual processing for testing
    >>> assert customer.name == "John Doe"
    >>> assert options.validate_email is True
    -->
    """
```

### Documentation Structure

- **MkDocs** with `mkdocstrings` for API documentation
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** for design decisions
- **Tutorial documentation** for each layer of the architecture
- **API reference** auto-generated from docstrings
- **Version control** with `mike` for documentation versioning

### Testing Documentation

- **Test strategy** documentation per architectural layer
- **Coverage reports** with detailed analysis
- **Performance benchmarks** and regression tracking
- **Security test documentation** and compliance reports </documentation>

<testing> ## Testing Strategy

### Coverage and Quality Requirements

- Minimum 80% code coverage across all layers
- 100% coverage for critical business logic (Dynamic layer)
- Property-based testing for domain entities (Semantic layer)
- Integration tests for data access (Kinetic layer)

### Test Organization by Layer

```python
# Semantic Layer Tests - Focus on domain logic
class TestPersonEntity:
    def test_person_creation_with_valid_data(self):
        """Test that Person entities are created correctly with valid data."""

    def test_person_business_rules_validation(self):
        """Test that business rules are enforced at the entity level."""

# Kinetic Layer Tests - Focus on data access and integration
class TestPersonRepository:
    async def test_person_retrieval_from_database(self):
        """Test that persons can be retrieved from database correctly."""

    async def test_person_data_mapping_accuracy(self):
        """Test that database data maps correctly to domain entities."""

# Dynamic Layer Tests - Focus on business logic and workflows
class TestPersonService:
    async def test_person_creation_business_logic(self):
        """Test that person creation follows all business rules."""

    async def test_person_workflow_state_transitions(self):
        """Test that person lifecycle transitions work correctly."""
```

### Testing Utilities

- **Fixtures** for each architectural layer
- **Mocks and stubs** for external dependencies
- **Test data builders** with factory patterns
- **Async test support** with pytest-asyncio
- **Database test containers** for integration tests </testing>

<workflow> ## Development Workflow

### Code Implementation Process

1. **Domain-First Development**: Start with Semantic layer entities and relationships
2. **Contract Definition**: Define repository and service protocols
3. **Test-Driven Implementation**: Write tests before implementing Kinetic and Dynamic layers
4. **Integration Validation**: Ensure proper layer integration and data flow
5. **Documentation Completion**: Complete all docstrings and architectural documentation

### Quality Assurance Checklist

- [ ] All functions/classes have comprehensive Google-style docstrings
- [ ] Runnable examples included in all docstrings
- [ ] Test coverage meets 80% minimum threshold
- [ ] Static type checking passes with `mypy --strict`
- [ ] Code formatting consistent with `black` and `isort`
- [ ] Integration tests cover layer boundaries
- [ ] Documentation builds successfully with MkDocs
- [ ] CLI interface provides access to core functionality
- [ ] Docker containers build and run correctly
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes all stages

### Response Requirements

When providing coding assistance:

1. **Always provide complete, working code** - no placeholders or partial implementations
2. **Include full docstrings** with examples and tests for every code element
3. **Explain architectural layer placement** and justify design decisions
4. **Provide step-by-step reasoning** for implementation choices
5. **Show integration examples** between layers
6. **Include error handling** and logging where appropriate
7. **Demonstrate testing approach** for the implemented code

### Forbidden Practices

- Generic placeholder language ("repeat for all functions")
- Incomplete docstrings without examples
- Code without proper type annotations
- Missing error handling and logging
- Tight coupling between architectural layers
- Hardcoded configuration values
- Synchronous I/O for external operations </workflow>

<examples> ## Layer Integration Example

```python
# Semantic Layer - Domain Entity
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Customer:
    """Customer entity representing a business customer."""
    id: UUID
    name: str
    email: str
    status: CustomerStatus
    created_at: datetime

# Kinetic Layer - Repository Protocol and Implementation
class CustomerRepository(Protocol):
    """Protocol defining customer data access contract."""
    async def get_by_id(self, customer_id: UUID) -> Optional[Customer]: ...
    async def create(self, customer: Customer) -> Customer: ...

class SQLCustomerRepository:
    """SQL implementation of customer repository."""
    # Implementation handles database mapping

# Dynamic Layer - Business Service
class CustomerService:
    """Service implementing customer business logic."""
    def __init__(self, repository: CustomerRepository): ...
    async def create_customer(self, name: str, email: str) -> Customer: ...
    # Implementation includes business rule validation

# CLI Integration
@cli.command()
async def create_customer(name: str, email: str) -> None:
    """Create a new customer via CLI."""
    # Uses dependency injection to wire layers together
```

</examples>

Remember: Your success is measured by the clarity of architecture, quality of implementation, and maintainability of the resulting code. Always think step-by-step and provide complete, working solutions that exemplify these architectural principles.
